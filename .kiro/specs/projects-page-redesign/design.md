# Design Document

## Overview

The projects page redesign will transform the current grid-based layout into a design that matches the about section's project display. The new design will feature StableWise prominently at the top, followed by other projects in a scrollable section, all using the same visual components and styling patterns from the about section.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
Projects Page
├── Background System (existing)
├── Page Header
├── Featured Project Section
│   └── About Section ProjectCard (StableWise)
└── Other Projects Section
    └── Scrollable Container
        └── Multiple About Section ProjectCards
```

### Data Flow
1. Projects data will be extracted from the existing about section data structure
2. StableWise will be identified and separated as the featured project
3. Remaining projects will be filtered into the "Other Projects" section
4. Both sections will use the same ProjectCard component from the about section

## Components and Interfaces

### Modified Projects Page Component
- **Location**: `src/app/(sub pages)/projects/page.js`
- **Purpose**: Main page component that orchestrates the new layout
- **Key Changes**:
  - Import and use the about section's ProjectCard component
  - Implement featured project section with StableWise
  - Create scrollable container for other projects
  - Apply consistent styling with about section

### Reused ProjectCard Component
- **Location**: `src/components/about/ProjectCard.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Display individual project information with consistent styling
- **Usage**: Will be imported and used directly without modifications
- **Features**: Maintains existing status indicators, demo links, and responsive design

### Projects Data Integration
- **Source**: Extract project data from `src/components/about/index.jsx`
- **Structure**: Maintain existing project object structure with id, title, description, status, imageUrl, and demoLink
- **Featured Logic**: Filter projects array to separate StableWise from others

## Data Models

### Project Object Structure
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  status: string, // "MVP" | "Completed" | "Ongoing" | "Pre-seed" | "On Hold" | "In Progress"
  imageUrl: string,
  demoLink: string
}
```

### Page State
```javascript
{
  featuredProject: Project, // StableWise project object
  otherProjects: Project[], // All projects except StableWise
  isLoading: boolean
}
```

## Layout Design

### Featured Project Section
- **Layout**: Full-width container with centered content
- **Styling**: Enhanced visual treatment with larger size and prominent positioning
- **Content**: Single StableWise project using about section's ProjectCard
- **Spacing**: Generous margins and padding for visual emphasis

### Other Projects Section
- **Layout**: Scrollable container with consistent spacing
- **Height**: Fixed height (400px-600px) with overflow-y-auto
- **Styling**: Same glass-scrollbar styling as about section
- **Content**: All projects except StableWise in vertical stack

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with stacked sections
- **Tablet**: Maintain single column with adjusted spacing
- **Desktop**: Full-width layout with optimized spacing

## Styling Approach

### CSS Classes and Styling
- Reuse existing about section styling patterns
- Apply `glass-scrollbar` class for consistent scrollbar appearance
- Use same color scheme: `#FEFE5B` for headings, gray tones for text
- Maintain existing responsive text sizing classes

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Page Title**: Large, centered heading
2. **Featured Project**: Prominent section with "Featured Project" heading
3. **Other Projects**: Secondary section with clear separation
4. **Individual Projects**: Consistent card styling throughout

## Error Handling

### Image Loading
- Maintain existing Image component error handling
- Preserve fallback behavior for missing project images
- Ensure graceful degradation for broken image links

### Data Validation
- Validate project data structure before rendering
- Handle missing or malformed project objects
- Provide fallback content for empty project arrays

### Component Error Boundaries
- Leverage existing ErrorBoundary components
- Ensure page remains functional if individual project cards fail
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Test ProjectCard component integration with projects page
- Verify featured project filtering logic
- Validate responsive design across device sizes

### Visual Regression Testing
- Compare new design with about section for consistency
- Test scrollable container behavior
- Verify proper spacing and alignment

### Accessibility Testing
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Validate keyboard navigation for scrollable content
- Test screen reader compatibility with project information

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load project images for improved performance
- Optimize scrollable container for smooth scrolling
- Maintain existing dynamic import patterns for background components
