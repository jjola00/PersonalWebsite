# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Extract and centralize project data
  - Create a shared projects data file that can be used by both about and projects pages
  - Extract the projects array from the about section into a reusable data structure
  - Ensure the data structure matches the existing project object format
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 2. Update projects page to use about section design
  - Import the ProjectCard component from the about section
  - Replace the current projects page layout with the about section design pattern
  - Implement the featured project section with StableWise highlighted
  - Create the scrollable "Other Projects" section using the same styling as about section
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Implement project filtering and display logic
  - Add logic to separate StableWise as the featured project
  - Filter remaining projects for the "Other Projects" section
  - Ensure proper data flow from centralized project data to display components
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Apply consistent styling and responsive design

- [ ]* 5. Add comprehensive testing
  - Write unit tests for project filtering logic
  - Test responsive design across different screen sizes
  - Verify proper integration of about section components
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ]* 6. Performance optimization and error handling
  - Ensure proper image loading and error handling
  - Optimize scrollable container performance
  - Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.5_
