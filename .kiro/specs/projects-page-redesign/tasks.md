# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Extract and centralize project data
  - Create a shared projects data file from the about section's project array
  - Extract the projects data into a reusable format that works with the current ProjectCard component
  - Ensure the data structure is compatible with existing projects page expectations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Update projects page to use real project data
  - Replace the placeholder project data with the real project data from about section
  - Set StableWise as the featured project in the existing "Featured Projects" section
  - Update the "Other Projects" section with remaining real projects
  - Maintain the current layout, styling, and ProjectCard component usage
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Adapt data structure for current ProjectCard component
  - Map the about section's project data structure to match current ProjectCard expectations
  - Ensure proper handling of project properties like technologies, githubUrl, liveUrl
  - Update project filtering logic to separate StableWise from other projects
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Verify and test the integration
  - Ensure all project links and information display correctly
  - Verify that the existing responsive design works with real project data
  - Test that StableWise appears correctly in the featured section
  - Confirm that all project images and demo links work properly
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 2.5, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ]* 5. Add comprehensive testing
  - Write unit tests for project data mapping and filtering logic
  - Test responsive design with real project data across different screen sizes
  - Verify proper integration and data flow
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ]* 6. Performance optimization and error handling
  - Ensure proper image loading and error handling for real project images
  - Optimize performance with actual project data
  - Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.5_
