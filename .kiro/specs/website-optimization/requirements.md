# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses performance optimization, code cleanup, security vulnerabilities, and deployment stability issues in the Next.js portfolio website. The system currently experiences slow loading times, contains unused code bloat, has iframe security warnings, JavaScript initialization errors, and Netlify deployment failures.

## Glossary

- **Website_System**: The Next.js portfolio website application
- **Performance_Metrics**: Page load times, bundle sizes, and runtime performance indicators
- **Code_Bloat**: Unused dependencies, dead code, and redundant implementations
- **Security_Vulnerabilities**: Iframe sandbox escaping and other client-side security issues
- **Deployment_Pipeline**: Netlify build and deployment process
- **Bundle_Analyzer**: Tool for analyzing JavaScript bundle composition and sizes
- **Dead_Code**: Unused functions, components, or imports in the codebase

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the site to load quickly and perform smoothly, so that I can navigate and interact with content without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page, THE Website_System SHALL load the initial content within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages, THE Website_System SHALL complete page transitions within 1 second
3. THE Website_System SHALL achieve a Lighthouse performance score of at least 85
4. THE Website_System SHALL have a total JavaScript bundle size under 500KB compressed
5. WHEN Performance_Metrics are measured, THE Website_System SHALL show improvement of at least 30% in load times compared to current baseline

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all unused code and dependencies, so that the application is maintainable and performs optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Website_System SHALL contain no unused npm dependencies in package.json
2. THE Website_System SHALL contain no Dead_Code in JavaScript or CSS files
3. WHEN Bundle_Analyzer runs, THE Website_System SHALL show no duplicate dependencies
4. THE Website_System SHALL have all imports properly tree-shaken during build
5. THE Website_System SHALL contain no unused CSS classes or styles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all security vulnerabilities to be resolved, so that my browsing experience is safe and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Website_System SHALL contain no iframes with both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin sandbox attributes
2. THE Website_System SHALL resolve all JavaScript initialization errors
3. WHEN security scanning tools run, THE Website_System SHALL report zero high or critical vulnerabilities
4. THE Website_System SHALL implement proper Content Security Policy headers
5. THE Website_System SHALL sanitize all user inputs and external content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable deployments to Netlify, so that updates can be published without build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL complete successfully within 10 minutes
2. THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL produce no build errors or warnings
3. THE Website_System SHALL have consistent environment variable configuration between local and production
4. THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL generate optimized production builds
5. WHEN deployment completes, THE Website_System SHALL be accessible and functional on the live URL

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and organized code structure, so that the application is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Website_System SHALL have consistent code formatting and linting rules applied
2. THE Website_System SHALL follow Next.js best practices for file organization
